1)==>Writing an algorithm for driving from my place to fav destination(Hyd to Mumbai)

1)Plan your Route:-
*Use a Mapping service or GPS device to determine the best route from Hyd to Mumbai.
*Consider factor such as distance ,road conditions and traffic.

2)Prepare Your Vehicle:
*Check Your vehicle is in good condition for a long journey.
*Check the fuel level,oiltires,brakes and etc...

3)Pack Essentials:
*it means such as water,snacks,first aid kit,neccesary documents (license,Registration papers,insurence) and emergency supplies.

4)Start journey:
*Depart from your location in hyderabad and follow the planned route towards mumbai.

5)Follow Traffic Rules:
*Obey the traffic rules,speed limits,and other traffic rule to ensure a safe journey.

6)Drive Safely:
*Maintain a safe speed and distance from the other vehicles and use turn signal and mirrors when changing turning.

7)Tea Break:
*Take regular breaks to rest,stretch,and refresh yourself to get an energy.

8)Fuel and mileage:
*Keep an eye on your fuel gauge and plan fuel stops accordingly and calucate the mileage to have sufficient fuel for the journey.

9)Navigate Road challenges:
*Be prepared for road diversions

10)Arrival in Mumbai:
*Follow directions to your specific destination within the city if needed.

11)End of journey:
*Once you reach the destination ,park your vehicle safely.

12)Return Journey(Optional)

2===>Writing an algorithm for Registering & logging into website.

Registraion Algorith:

1)User Input:

*The user to provide necessary information for registration such as username, email address, password, etc.

2)Validate Input:

*Verify that all required fields are filled out.
*Check for valid email format.
*Ensure password meets security requirements (e.g., minimum length, containing both letters and numbers).

3)Check for Duplicate Entries:
*Verify that the username and email address provided are not already registered in the system.
*If duplicates are found, prompt the user to choose different credentials.


4)Store User Information:

*If input passes validation and no duplicates are found, store the user's information in the database.

5)Confirmation:

*Provide confirmation to the user that registration was successful.
*Optionally, send a confirmation email for account activation.

6)Login Algorithm:

1)User Input:

*enter the username/email and password.

2)Validate Input:

*Verify that both fields are filled out.

3)Check Credentials:

*Retrieve the user's information from the database based on the provided username/email.
*If credentials match, proceed to login. If not, prompt the user to re-enter correct credentials.

4)Session Creation:

*Upon successful login, create a session for the user to maintain their logged-in state.
*Store session information (e.g., user ID, username) securely.

5)Redirect or Display Dashboard:

*Redirect the user to the appropriate page (e.g., dashboard, homepage) after successful login.

*Display a welcome message or user-specific content.


6)Logout Option:

*Provide an option for the user to logout, which destroys the session and logs them out of the website.

3==>Writing an algorithm to check if a number is negative number or positive number

1)Input a number from the user.
2)If number is less than zero, then it is a negative integer.
3)Else if number is greater than zero, then it is a positive integer.
4)Else, the number is equal to zero.
5)End.

==============================================================

4==>Writing an algorithm to check if a number is prime

1: Take num as input. 
2: Initialize a variable temp to 1.
3: Iterate a “for” loop from 2 to sqrt(num).
4: If num is divisible by loop iterator, then update temp value to 0

===============================================================

5==>Writing an algorithm to check if a number is amstrong

1:Enter any Number

2: Find the cube of each digit of the entered number.

3: Then, add the cube of all the digits.

4: If the result of step 3 is equal to the entered number, i.e., Step 1. Then the print entered number is an Armstrong number.

5: If the result of step 3 is equal to the entered number, i.e., Step 1. Then print entered number is not an Armstrong number.

===============================================================

6==>Writing an algorithm to check if a year is leap year or not.

1-Take an integer variable

2- Assign values to the variable

3- Check whether a year is divisible by four but not with hundred and print leap year.

4- Check if a year is divisible by four hundred and print leap year

5- Otherwise, print not leap year

================================================================

7====Writing an algorithm to find n factorial of a number

1.We initialize the result variable to 1, as 1! is defined as 1.
2.Starting from 2, we iterate through all the integers up to n .
3.In each iteration, we multiply the result by the current integer i .
4.Finally, we return the result as the factorial of n .

================================================================

8===>

1.START
2. Declare variable n1, n2, sum, n, i 
*Initialize variables: n1 = 0, n2 = 1, i = 2 
3.Read n 
4: Repeat this step until i <= n: 

sum = n1 + n2 
print sum 
n1 = n2 
n2 = sum 
i = i + 1
5: STOP 

========================================================

9==

1. Start

2. Read the value of start_position and end_position

3. Initialize an empty list even_numbers[] to store even numbers

4. For each index i from start_position to end_position, do
      4.1 If array[i] is divisible by 2 with remainder 0, then
             4.1.1 Append array[i] to even_numbers[]

5. If even_numbers[] is not empty, then
      5.1 Print "Even numbers between position {start_position} and position {end_position} are: "
      5.2 For each number in even_numbers[], do
             5.2.1 Print the number
      5.3 Go to step 6
   Else
      5.4 Print "No even numbers found between position {start_position} and position {end_position}"

6. Stop

================================================================

10==Writing an algorithm to find the sum of sub-array you pick dynamically should be greater than 10 and copy those values (not the sum) into another array.


1. Start

2. Initialize an empty list new_array[] to store values of sub-arrays with a sum greater than 10

3. For each starting index i from 0 to the length of the array - 1, do
      3.1 Initialize sum = 0
      3.2 For each ending index j from i to the length of the array - 1, do
             3.2.1 Add array[j] to sum
             3.2.2 If sum is greater than 10, then
                       3.2.2.1 Append array[i:j+1] to new_array[] (copy the values of the sub-array)
                       3.2.2.2 Break out of the loop

4. If new_array[] is not empty, then
      4.1 Print "Sub-arrays with a sum greater than 10:"
      4.2 For each sub-array in new_array[], do
             4.2.1 Print the values of the sub-array
      4.3 Go to step 5
   Else
      4.4 Print "No sub-array found with a sum greater than 10"

5. Stop
